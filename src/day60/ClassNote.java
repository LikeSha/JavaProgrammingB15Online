 *
 *   first I did not care about duplicates
 *   I would just created List and keep adding all your state into it
 *
 *
 * Scenario 2:
 *   then I realize there are many students from same states , and I want to only store the unique states you are from
 *
 * So I need some kind of data structure already does it for me
 * So I don't have to use bunch of if statements to handle it
 *
 *    Set interface is a data structure for unique element
 *
 * Scenario 3:
 *   now I want to actually store the student-state pair
 *   so I can get the state by student name
