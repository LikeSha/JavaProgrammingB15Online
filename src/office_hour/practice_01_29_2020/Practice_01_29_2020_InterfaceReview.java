     * what we can have inside an interface :
     *
     * public static final field field(constant)
     * abstract method (no-body)
     * default method (must have body : usually default implementation)
     * static method ( must have body : not inherited , use in static way)
     *
     * ALL OF THEM ARE optional
     * is  there any interface that has nothing inside ? YES
     * it's known as marker interface
     * A marker interface is an interface that has no methods or constants inside it.
     * It provides run-time type information about objects,
     * so the compiler and JVM have additional information about the object.
     * A marker interface is also called a tagging interface
