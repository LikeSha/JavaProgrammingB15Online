    Polymorphism: ability of the object in many forms

   if the super class/super-type is reference to sub class object

   IS-A relationship: Inherited relation

      example: class A extends B
               class Animal{

               }
               class Tiger extends Animal{

               }
               Tiger IS An Animal

   Has-A: instance of the A class is being used by B class
          whenever a class object being used by other class ,
          they have no inheritance relationship, no super sub relationship

          example :

          class Zoo{
              Tiger obj = new Tiger();
          }
     */
}
