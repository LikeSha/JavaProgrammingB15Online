     * Access-modifiers : public,protected ,default ,private
     *
     * private : only visible or accessible within the class
     *
     *instance variable : declared within the class, outside any methods & blocks
     *                    belong to the object
     *                    each object they have their own copy of instance variable
     *
     * Constructor : every class MUST have  . if we don't crate one ,
     * the compiler created one default(non arg) for you
     *
     * get executed as soon as we create the object of the class
     *
     * declaration :
     *      Access-modifier  ClassName(parameter){
     *            statement;
     *      }

     * creating object of the class:

     * Encapsulation : data hiding
     *  1,data has private access modifier
     *  2,grants other classes get access to the private data through getter/setter methods
     *
     *  getter(Read Only) : instance method
     *  what dose this getter functionality achieve ?  it just read , returns the value of private data
     *              return type of the method MUST match with the private data data type
     *
     * setter(Modify): instance method
     *                 does not return anything
     *                 return-type MUST be void
     *                 passes a parameter parameter's data type MUST match with the private data-type
     *
     * this: refers to object instance
     *  this " used to call instance varaible and instance methods
     *
     *  if the local variable has same variable name with instance variable ,then we
