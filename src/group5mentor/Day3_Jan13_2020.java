     * Object -- it's an instance of a class ( remember this sentence ,its interview question)

     * today's agenda : agile topic
     * the difference between agile environment and waterfall environment
     *
     * agile always open to change , this is building agile environment , you can do the testing any stage
     * ad example when interview : the company always use agile and jira , they gonna build up application
     * in two years. they usually build up app in the beginning . I can make any change that I want .
     * whenever client want to make a change ,the company must follow client requirement
     *
     * waterfall you can not make any change during the building up app process.
     *
     * whenever you answer this question ,you give example .
     *
     * 	the advantage and disadvantage of agile and waterfall environment :
     * 	waterfall , because of SDLC process , the requirement ...they will be well written in the beginning
     * 	in agile ,every time we take a small piece , we are delivering piece by piece
     *
     * 	waterfall , the deployment slow ,
     * 	in agile deployment and production is really fast
     *
     * 	when you find bug in waterfall , the fix bug cost is more than agile .because if the bug is major
     * 	problem , it really cost company money .
     *
     * 	in my resume ,I write I have worked in agile environment . they ask you what is your daily
     * 	activities . remember this  : waterfall is always follow SDLC  agile always open to change .

     *     in general ,one sprint cycle is 2 weeks long ,the work days are 10 days . we need to give
     *      measurment to each user story, one user point is = one day .I am working in two weeks
