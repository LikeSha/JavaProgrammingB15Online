     * Today we go over some interview questions
     *
     * what component of collection ? List , map ,set , queue , queue is almost not used alot
     * we only remember list and map
     *
     * list major functionality : its first in first out FIFO, which is the data you store
     * it will store alphabetically , if you store 5,3,9 ,it just follow the exactly order
     * it allows the duplication ,if you have two 35 , it allowed ,
     * but set does not allow duplication
     * it only allow store one value
     *
     * map and list and set are three important components.
     *
     *
     *
     * what is your daily activities ?
     * mentor answer version :
     * I arrive office 9--9:30 am ,first thing I do is grab my coffee, then check email,
     * to see there is any update ,then I double check my calendar ,to see any meeting ,then
     * stand up meeting , most stand up meeting are 15--30 minutes, after that I just go back
     * to my work, work on my story, maybe by 12-1:00 i go out for lunch, then go back to my desk
     * keep working my story, if any meeting ,i WILL attend, for example ,engineering meeting,
     * even I don'tt know what they do, we all come together ,only once in a month ,ppl in the
     * upper side like managers ,they will attend, and WE JUST listen, its kind a tech demo,
     * then I attend sprint planing meeting if in my calendar , most time planning meeting about
     * 1 hour , sometimes PO or our team lead create story , if they ask you "don't you have
     * review meeting ?" I would just say we didnt have ," whos gonna review the work you have
     * done ?  I would just say Product Owner ,we don't involve that as a tester .
     *
     * what is four concepts of OOP ?
     * Inheretance ( two key words : extends  and class ),Encapsulation, Polymorphism( object is keyword)
     *
     * Encapsulation ONLY make object private .( private ,access modifier and object 3 key words)
     *
     * Polymorphism :
     *
     * abstraction : we use method overloading , overwrite the method ,whenever you call it ,
     * you will hide your method in abstract class
     *
     * what is difference : static block, constructor and method ?
     *
     *
