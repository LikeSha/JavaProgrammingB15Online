    /**
     *today mentor Muhammad Turghun  will give some his real time manual testing examples
     * JIRA is a system management tool  not only bug testing tool
     *
     * MRN : Medical Record Number  RPT--Report
     * they are using solar system which is a search engine , this engine searching from database and
     * his job is doing manual testing--matching database data to solar system, to find out anything difference!
     * his company data base is SQL  SQL language key word is SELECT ...
     *
     * interview : user stories is used written by the PO and also closed ( done ) by him
     *
     *
     * in STLC. let's say I found a bug then we need to determine the priority of the bug by level.
     * There are 2 levels of the bug.
     * Developers will identify the level of bug by influence on functions.
     * Bug priorities given by developers are(concerned most the fixing time and cost):
     * 1- st one is critical - has big impact to function. 2nd one is major.
     * 3rd one is Moderate and last one is Low.
     * Bug priorities given by testers are(concerned mostly for the defect to functionality):
     * 1-Critical 2-High 3 -Medium 4-Low
     *
     * interview : when you found bug , there are two priority level : critical ,minor ,.....
     * in the STLC ,I found a bug ,usually there are 2 levels of prioritizing the bug itself , depending the
     * how big the impact the bug has, the decision is given to the testers , let say if it is a bug and causing
     * a critical issue, I am not able to log in amazon , the website is not accepting my log in information ,this
     * is the big issue , and the bug I found ,this could be a major impact of....this is called critical level
     * the second level is called  major level . Defect Severity Levels given by developers or the ppl from
     * the business side . the testers will always think how    the developer site alway think how soon it
     * should be resolved ..its two completely different concept ?
     * Defect Priority Levels is given by testers. this two level being given is related what bug you found
     * so you must found a bug first ,then this two category given
     *
     *
     * Before you write (enter) you test step there is another process you need to do ,what is it ?
     * its negative test
     *
     *(after you finish your test case ,you do peer review to check anything not including .)
     *
     * understand white box and black box testing : black box testing doesn't involve the logic or the requirement
     * it only focus on the end result . black box testing focus on user interface testing , front desk testing .
     * white box testing is focusing on the application internal side .
     * white box testing and black box testing are testing type . you can always automate test them ,
     *
     * what is QA environment  ? first one is development environment ,it could be website ,it could be server ,
     * any kind of coding ,designing in that environment .second one is environment is QA , once the coding (development)is done
     * then testing start ,  then( third one is ) production environment then we give to the end users , these are four
     * different environments. Some companies only have two environment : development and QA
     *
     *after all colomn done in jira, the last step is called " defination of done " to show all result
     * to your scrum master .
     *
     * in JIRA tool there is no column called " Acceptance Criteria " you should ask   what is acceptance criteria
     *
     * acceptance criteria does't really come with user story in real life ( company )
     *
