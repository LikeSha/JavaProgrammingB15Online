     * Today is February 26,2020
     * Agenda : HTML + CSS
     *
     * what is HTML ?
     *   HTML its an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language
     *   It's not like programming language, it's a markup language. Used for development of web sites. To be more specific,
     *   front-end part.
     *
     *   Why do we need html in test automation ?
     *   --To crate locators  locator--its like a pointer on the element.You want your script to read some text, find that element first ,
     *   with the locator , and then read the tex .
     *   We don't need to know a lot about HTML, Just basics.
     *   What is tag, attribute ,and text...No development here , just locators . Also , locators, its a separated selenium topic,
     *   We will cover it later. I have short videos on canvas about locators and how to find it .
     *
     *   Web sites/Web applications have 2 sides: front-end and back-end. User, I mean regular user interacts only with the front-end.
     *   As a tester, we might be testing everything. Front and back.
     *
     *   front-end --HTML + CSS + JavaScript ( to display data content  )
     *
     *   back-end --- business logic + data base
     *
     *   business logic --java,c#,python......... (to process data )
     *
     *   data base --SQL and NoSQL...(to store data )
     *
     *   In HTML, We have lots of tags, We use tags to define elements.
     *   For instance ,I want to crate a basic web page. What should I do ?
     *   1. Create a .html document
     *   2. Use some good text editor, that will help you to write a code faster . That gives you some hints, auto-complete, etc...
     *   Sublime is the good one , You can also use Intellij, but free version doesnt have a lot of useful features.That's why we
     *   use sublime. Other poplular alternatives are :
     *   Atom, Notepad++( windows) and Visual Studio Code ( completely free and has great features)
     *   3. Then, you must start with <html> tag . <httml> tag is a root tag in HTML . Most of the tags, have 2 parts : opening <body>
     *       and closing </body>. Then, content goes in between opening and closing tag.Tag name is surrounded with angle brackets.
     *
     *       < this one is called angle bracket
     *       <body> its a tag </body>
     *       Then, we have 2 parts: head and body. All page content goes into body. In the head, we have some meta data,
     *       different imports( like framework, fonts, etc...),title and some other technical info......
     *
     *       some tags, like <img> are autocloseable .
     *       then, inside tags , we can put attributes.
     *       For example: <img src="path/image.jpeg" alt="some name">
     *           In this case , img is a tag
     *                          src and alt is attribute
     *           src --- to specify where to find the image , that you want to insert here
     *           alt--if image wasn't found ,show this message
     *           <ol>  order list                  </ol> closing tag ALWAYS WITH A SLASH IN FRONT content and inside angle bracket
     *            <li> list item                   </li>
     *
     *            <table> THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT SELENIUM INTERVIEW QUESTION !!!
     *            <tr>  table row
     *            <td> table data
     *            <th> table header
     *
     *  Chrome as a broser can read html file
     *
     *  font-fmaili : 'Nunito', sans-serif;
