     * How many scrum roles in Agile scrum ?
     * PO, Scrum Master, Scrum development team ( dev ,testers ,BA, DBA( DATA BASE ANALYSTS) )
     * when you talk about your team ,we use team terminology .
     * team--> PO,Scrum master , scrum team.
     * my tester team can finish user stories .
     *

     *
     * Who accept all user stoRIes ? po
     *
     * can you talk about scrum meeting ?
     *
     *  explain the "definition of ready" ?
     * Answer : in general , all user stories updated ,points are given to user stories ,
     * Nothing missing in Acceptance Cretira ,sprint backlog created.So we are ready to
     * start sprint.
     *

     *
     *
     * explain your scrum team ?
     *
     * what you do in sprint planning meeting ? what you should be done in planning ? give a point ! purpose :
     * need to come to solution how many user stories need to be done . and prioritized them then create sprint
     * backlog.
     *
     * Definition of Done?
     * its talking about complete sprint :.
     * check test cases done or not ,
     * all bugs are closed or not ,
     * all tests should marked as pass

     *
     * Team capacity ;
     * in your scrum team ( 5 dev, 6 testers, 1BA,1 DBA)
     * TEAM CAPACITY = testers number * 8
     *
     * Software Testing Life Cycle ---STLC
     *
     * interview question : can you tell me about STLC ?
     * Interview question :If I give you a requirement how you test ? what is your approach testing that requirement ?
     * Requirement = User Story
     *
     * My approach is :
     * 1, analyze requirement;
     * 2, create test plan ,mostly done by team lead or testers
     * 3, create test case ;
     * 4, set up environment;( test environment, dev environment ,production environment..)
     * 5, execute test;
     * 6, Test cycle closure ( close test )
     *
     *
     * STLC STEP 2 : Test plan creation -- is for project ONLY DO ONE TIME .
     *      STEP 6 : TEST CYCLE CLOSURE -- ONLY DO ONE TIME
     *      other steps all repeated . every single user story we need to repeat above test
     *      processure ( not including step 2 and 6 )
     * letsdotesting.com
     *
     * 1.User should be able to login page really quickly ( you should ask BA to update how quickly because this
     * requirement not specific . lets say ---0.5 second
     *
     * Requirement Tracibility Matrix ? RTM
     * It is a document showing the relationship between requirements and test cases. RTM is done by team lead
     *
     * Test plan (SDLC LEVEL/PROJECT OR SPRINT LEVEL) who write test plan ? team lead  or testers
     * O&M --- Operation and management ( team )
     * REG---REGRESSION Reg
     * QC team means testing team ( Quality Control team )
     *
     * TEST CASE :
     * As authorized user I should be able to see "Admin" module on Canvas
     * instructor -->authorized user.
     * instructor user credential
     * pre-condition : I should have authorized user(test data)
     *
     * in JIRA  test case ID are auto generated ,also called ticket number in JIRA.
     * positive scenario--> happy path
     *
     * what you do if expected result is not matching with actual result .
     * test case VS test script
     * test case --> manual testing
     * test script --> automation testing .
     *
     * My expectation of today's class :
     * you should know about :
     * 1.SDLC --> How many steps include ? what are they ?
     * 2,what activities should be done in first step of STLC(Requirement analysis?)
     * 3.what is test plan document ? who writes / creates test plan doc
     * 4.what is test case ? difference between test case and test scenario?
     * 5.how to create test case ?
     * 6.which
     *
     * WIP--Working In Progress
     *
     * which tools use for manual tesing ?  we are using jiraXray, we created test cases through
     * jira , and upload our screen shots or recordings if our test cases are failed ,we open a
     * bug and assign it to developers . this is the main tool that we are using for manual testing.
