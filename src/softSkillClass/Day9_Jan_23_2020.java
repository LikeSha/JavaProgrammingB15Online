     * Interview question :If I give you a requirement how you test ? what is your approach testing that requirement ?
     * Requirement = User Story
     *
     * STLC STEP 2 : Test plan creation -- is for project ONLY DO ONE TIME .
     *      STEP 6 : TEST CYCLE CLOSURE -- ONLY DO ONE TIME
     *      other steps all repeated .
     * letsdotesting.com
     *
     * 1.User should be able to login page really quickly ( you should ask BA to update how quickly because this
     * requirement not specific . lets say ---0.5 second
     *
     * Requirement Tracibility Matrix ? RTM
     * It is a document showing the relationship between requirements and test cases. RTM is done by team lead

     * TEST CASE :
     * As authorized user I should be able to see "Admin" module on Canvas
     * instructor -->authorized user.
     * instructor user credential
     * pre-condition : I should have authorized user(test data)

     * in JIRA  test case ID are auto generated ,also called ticket number in JIRA.
     * positive scenario--> happy path
     *
     * what you do if expected result is not matching with actual result .
     * test case VS test script
     * test case --> manual testing
     * test script --> automation testing .
     *
