     * How does code review might happen ? ( how your team doing code review?)
     *
     * There are two ways of doing code review :
     *
     * 1.we can do it through Github,in Github we have something called " pull request",
     * how does pull request work is : whenever you want to merge your branch with the master branch,
     * you have to raise a pull request,whenever you raised a pull request ,we have to have at least
     * two people approved that pull request within the team. This is the one way the code get
     * reviewed before you merged.
     *
     * 2. second way is : we just get together have a 30 minutes cession with team members,we just go
     * through all the codes together, then developers say " oh its good "  so our code review done.
