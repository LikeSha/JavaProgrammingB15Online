     * I have 8 people in my team.
     * 4 developers, 2 QA , 1 PO , 1 SM
     *
     * How many hours are you doing scrum activities in a day ?
     * typically 6 hours
     *
     * If I have 2 weeks sprint
     * 10 days x 6 hours = 60 hours <-------My individual capacity.
     *
     * (4+2) x 60 = 360 hours <-----Team capacity ( we have 4 dev and 2 QA ,TOTAL 6 PPL)
     *
     * In my company 1 point = 10 hours
     * So how many points worth of story I can complete within this sprint ?
     * 360/10=36 points.
     *
     * Velocity :
     *
     * If I work 100% velocity, I will complete 36 points worth of story by end of the sprint.
     * In real life , we always want to commit little bit more points than our capacity,
     * typically it's about 10% more , it's going to be roughly 40 points.
