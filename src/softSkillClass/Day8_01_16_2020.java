     * team capacity :
     * number of team member * 8 = team capacity
     * velocity : total point of user stories on sprint backlog.
     * velocity =<capacity
     * grooming meeting : give point for each user story
     * sprint planning : give a point + prioritize user stories and create sprint backlog.
     * if user stories deserve 2 points I give 3 points to avoid I loose point ( to avoid disadvantage for me in a team )
     *
     * right now we are at sprint 5 ,:           1 week              2 week

     1 tester can work  2 user stories  but in kanban , I have 2 user stories , one is complicated ,another one is
     simple one .kanban everything work is transparent , you have to finish one task then goes next to insure every
     team member is on the same page   visualizing your work . in kanban ,there is no sprint . kanban no PO
     but some companies still hire PO .
