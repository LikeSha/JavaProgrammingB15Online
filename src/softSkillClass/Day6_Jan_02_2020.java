         *
         * INTERVIEW QUESTION : Tell me about difference between test case and tese scenario ?
         * test case is bassically a documentation include test case ID, Test case description, pre-condition,
         * test data, test steps, expected result and actural result , then pass and fail
         *
         * test scenario is a higher level above than test case , it more general .if I give an example lets say
         * verify log in functionality when open up an application ,this is basically a test scenario .test case
         * would be more specific , test scenario including several test cases . for example log in functionality ,which
         * is a test scenario. one of a test case lets say student ,as a student , I should be able to log in
         * account with valid username  and valid password into my privacy account ,so I can check my grade , so this
         * is a one test case ,and its a positive test case ,I can write another case ,which is negative test case ,
         * the negative test case also belong to functionality test , lets say student log in with wrong
         * username or wrong password ,this is negative test case .
         *
