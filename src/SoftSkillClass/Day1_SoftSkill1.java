       /* Software development life cycle---
       // Agenda
       // Introduce basic terminologies
       //Review SDLC

        // Functionally --- is the ability of the system to do the work for which it was intended --key reason
        //of the system.
        //Feature --- A distinguishing character of a software item.
        // Module---is a standalone piece of code that provides specific and tightly coupled functionality.
       // Test Environment --A testing environment is a setup of software and hardware for the testing teams to
          execute test cases. (Development environment ,test environment, production environment)

          // SMART Criteria----Specific , Measurable , Attainable , Realistic, Testable.
            // User story = requirement  they are same thing ! You have to get the requirement before you
            // start testing
            //How to test the application if you don't have any requirement ? (Interview question)
            // Answer : Ask developer !!! ( only person you can ask for ) tell them " I don't have user story,
            // ask them about functionality and go to test application.Scrum manager don't know tech .
            // Answer :

            // Who assign                                         Answer : team leader

            // hotfix : hot fix - if smthg happened during production, and needs to be fixed right away
              // google hotfix : The term hotfix is generally used when client has found an issue within
              //the current release of the product and can not wait to be fixed until the next big release.
              //Hence a hotfix issue is created to fix it and is released as a part of update to the current release
              //usually called Cumulative Update(CU). CUs are nothing but a bunch of hotfixes together.

              //Bugfix - We usually use this when an issue is found during the development and testing phase internally.

              // Bug fix is an action on the source code, it is a code change or set of changes to address a reported code defect (a bug.)
              //A hotfix is generally a patch or update for clients / deployed systems but more specifically they are patches which are:-
              //•not released to a schedule.
              //•intended to address either 'niche' situations or 'emergency' responses.
              //•only relevant to the specific issue documented in the release notes.
              //•poorly tested. If at all.
              //•a potential source for the (re)introduction of bugs.
              //•intended for small audiences.
              //•likely to affect automated patching systems and require additional monitoring. Hotfixes may deploy a file/library with unusually high version number to prevent the hotfix from being patched over.
              //•supplied by the software maker directly to named contacts, not publically available. Customers are often expected to contact technical support to request hotfixes for example.
             //•frequently branched from the 'last known good' source tree. As a 'quick fix' the code used in the hotfix may never make it back into the main build (it may be that as a temporary fix a better solution requires more time/resources.)

              // SCRUM TEAM : is one team ,inside this team they have sub-team , but scrum master
              // only in charge manage team,
                // dev team--> person who has development back ground, but not develope the code often

                //testing team-->> who has testing back ground but main responsibility is assgining a ticket and
                // generate the report in each sprint.

                //BA team-->> Business Analysis team
                //DBA team---Data base administrator

                //SDLC
                // STLC--Testing life cycle
                // test case --- manual test only , use selenium

                //regression testing --modify functionality
                sprint 1-->10 functionalities
                sprint 2--> 5 new functionalities

                // minor regression -->> is happened at end of sprint.

                // is re-testing same as regression testing ?
                      re-tesing : fix bugs( specific functionalities fixed )
                      regression testing ( when testing whole production )

                 realease == deploy == push the code

                 // how's your regresssion ? our regression is 65% automated and
                    rest of them are done by manual .

                    // How often you do your regression ?
                       generally , we do our regression each 3 month or each 6 sprint.
                        ( another saying is less than 4 weeks)

                     // who decide sprint cycle ? scrum master .
