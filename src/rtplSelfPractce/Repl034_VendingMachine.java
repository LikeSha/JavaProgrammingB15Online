         machine. An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar, in 5-cent
         increments (25, 30, 35, . . . , 90, 95, or 100), and the machine accepts only a single
         dollar bill to pay for the item.

         - int variable itemPrice
         - int variables quarters, dimes, nickels
         - Scanner object

         The program accepts itemPrice, which is a price for the item you would like to purchase.

         Positive behavior:

         Please follow the example in the image. dots mean empty space.
         -Since the item price was entered 95, change is 1 nickel

         Negative behavior:

         If itemPrice is less than 25 or more than 100 cents, then display an error message:
         Invalid price!

         If itemPrice is not divisible by 5, then also display an error message:
         Invalid price!

         use (itemPrice % 5 == 0) expression to find it is divisible by 5.

         Do not display anything else.
