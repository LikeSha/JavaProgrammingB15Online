     * Soft skill :
     *
     *         three amigo meeting : developer, tester and Business Analyst ( BA ), its an informal meeting ,we can do anywhere
     *         who write the requirement ? BA
     *
     *         /How to test the application if you don't have any requirement ? (Interview question)
     *             // Answer : Ask developer !!! ( only person you can ask for ) tell them " I don't have user story,
     *             // ask them about functionality and go to test application.
     *
     *             Who assign requirements ( user stories) to testers  ? Answer :
     *             team leader  in developing team, developers assign the user stories to developers ,
     *             in testing team, test lead assign user stories to testers
     *
     *             unit testing done by developers ,and unit testing is white-box testing.
     *             white-box testing needs code knowledge
     *
     *             before testing ,testers need to :
     *
     *             1. read requirement
     *             2, start testing:
     *                 write test case; (after write test case, you start  manual testing)
     *
     *
     *             minor regression -->> is happened at end of each sprint.
     *             major regression--> normally every 3 months or every 6 sprint
     *
     *             is re-testing same as regression testing ? NO
     *                       re-testing : fix bugs( specific functionalities fixed )
     *                       regression testing ( when testing whole production )
     *
     *             How often you do your regression ?
     *                        generally , we do our regression each 3 month or each 6 sprint.
     *                         ( another saying is less than 4 weeks)
     *
     *             // who decide sprint cycle ? scrum master
     *
     *             // how's your regression ? our regression is 65% automated and
     *                     rest of them are done by manual .
     *                     the reason is not all functionalities can be done by automation ,you have to do manually .
     *
     *              our regression normally done by automated and takes about 3-4 hours
     *
     *      Unit testing is white box testing because unit test required test code.
     *
     *         Ad-Hoc testing is tesing without any plan or documentation. its considered as informal testing .
     *         its also call random testing or Monkey testing. also called Exploratory testing .
     *         lots of defects. good to perform ad-hoc testing once official testing is done and still sometimes
     *         left for testing.
     *
     *         Exploratory testing done by tester who dose not know anything about the application.
     *         the purpose of exploratory testing is : to learn and explore the application.
     *
     *         component testing = module testing ,testing each module separately
     *
     *         integreation testing tests after integrating mulitiple components to check
     *         if the system works fine or not.
     *
     *         UAT ---User Acceptance Testing  after system test has corrected ,
     *         the system will delivered to user or customer for acceptance testing ,
     *         sometimes stakeholders may be involved as well.
     *
     *         UAT testing : alpha testing (done by technical people)
     *                       beta testing (done by client, customer)
     *
     *         Interview question :
     *
     *         1, what type of testing have you done so far ?( they want to know your test level )
     *
     *            My previouse project, I working on functional testing . smoke testing,
     *            integration testing,system testing ,and regression testing .
     *            I also did manual and automation testing too.
     *
     *             interview questions:
     *
     *            How many test cases in your smoke testing ?
     *            20--30 test cases in my previouse project , and can be done within 30 minutes
     *
     *            the purpose of smoke testing :
     *            to make sure the environment is up and running , make sure the application is stable .
     *
     *
     *            the advantage of smoke testing is :
     *            1.it will help us quickly to identify the issue .
     *            2.testing team will not waste their time on perform any type of testing on faulty build.
